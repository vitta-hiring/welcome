### Delivering your solution

Pretty simple!

1. Save your solution on a public `Github` repository as `vc`-`c` `v`-`n` where:
    1. `c` is the challenge you chosed! Example: `be` for back-end, `fe` for front-end, etc! Check at the challenge's page!
    1. `v` is the version of the challenge! It can be `1.0`, `1.1`, `2.0`!
    1. `n` are the initials of your name! So Filipe Forattini would be `ff`!  
   
   **Attention!** If I choose the back-end challenge Square of Squares (BE2) I'd name my repository as `vc-be2.0-ff`.
1. Send an e-mail to `recrutamento@vitta.me` with the link to your repository;
1. Good luck and do your best!
